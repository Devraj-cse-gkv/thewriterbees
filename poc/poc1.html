                                        <p><p style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><span style="text-align: left;">In this vast universe, there is a plethora of fascinating and unknown phenomena that we have yet to discover. Science encourages us to explore the infinite expanse of space and the immeasurable depths of the oceans if we wish to satisfy our curiosity and uncover new and strange knowledge. There are countless secrets and mysteries concealed in these oceans and scattered throughout space, some of which may be right in front of us but beyond our comprehension, and others deliberately kept hidden from human civilization.</span></span></p><img src="../images/kingdom.jpg" style="width:75%;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><span style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: justify;">This particular tale is centered around the thriving and highly advanced city of "Samudra Nagar," which serves as the epicenter of all civilizations residing beneath the ocean's thick layers. Humans can only descend a few kilometers into the ocean, and thus, these cities remain undiscovered by those above the surface. The city of Samudra Nagar is situated at an unreachable depth where even the strongest vessels would be crushed under the immense pressure of the water, a mere 10% of the way towards the city's location. Its name was derived from being the capital and the largest of the civilizations residing beneath these mysterious layers. Additionally, the city held great significance, as it was blessed by the goddess Mariana, the deity of the seas and oceans.</span></span></span></p><img src="../images/king.jpeg" style="width:50%;display: block; margin-left: auto; float: left; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-right: 1em "><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><span style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: justify;">King Tarang ruled over a magnificent city and was known for his bravery and kindness. Many other civilizations obeyed him even though they were not a part of his kingdom, as the king had helped them on numerous occasions. He had a beautiful wife named Avantika, and together they had everything they could possibly desire, except for a child. The king was often overcome with sadness and depression over their inability to conceive, while Avantika remained hopeful that things would improve one day.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><span style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: justify;">One day, while King Tarang was lost in thought on the roof of his breathtaking palace, Queen Avantika approached him and asked if he was once again thinking about their child. "What else do we need, Avantika?" replied the king. "We have everything except a child, but this time my worries are much greater than that."</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Avantika was confused and asked the king to explain what he meant. With a heavy heart, Tarang revealed that there were not only cities and colonies that obeyed him or with whom he had a good relationship. There were also those who wished to capture Samudra Nagar, and they were more numerous than their allies.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Avantika was shocked and reminded the king of their powerful army, which had never been defeated in the previous hundred wars. "Then why worry?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">King Tarang revealed a secret about the city that even Avantika did not know. He explained that they had fought many wars with other kingdoms, but she did not know the reason behind those wars. He believed that it was time for her to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><span style="text-align: left;"></span></span></p><img src="../images/Pearl_Of_Transformation.webp" style="width:50%;display: block; margin-left: auto; float: right; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 1em "><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Together, they went to the great door of the city, which was worshipped by the creatures of Samudra Nagar as the door to heaven. The king instructed everyone to leave, and then he inserted his sword into a gap that appeared to be a huge keyhole. The door opened, revealing a dark place with nothing visible except a glowing pearl that looked like a star.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">As Avantika tried to approach it, Tarang stopped her and cast a spell that caused his sword to glow. Suddenly, the great room was visible, and Avantika saw that it was not just the pearl but was also filled with giant creatures with large teeth and black eyes, capable of swallowing a cruise ship whole. Avantika was filled with terror, but the king reassured her that these were the guardians of the pearl and would not harm them.</span></p><img src="../images/sea-monster1.jpg" style="width:50%;display: block; margin-left: auto; float: left; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-right: 1em "><img src="../images/sea-monster2.webp" style="width:50%;display: block; margin-left: auto; float: right; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 1em "><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"Observe them, they are immense and intimidating. What if they fail to recognize you and attack? Please step back. I do not require any knowledge of this." Queen Avantika stated.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">The King chuckled and responded, "They do not recognize anyone except for the one who possesses this sword. It is the only way to enter and obtain that pearl. If someone else attempts to do so without the sword, you can imagine what might happen to them."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">King Tarang escorted her to the pearl, and Queen Avantika yearned to grasp its beauty. However, the King intervened and explained that if anyone other than the pearl's protector touched it, they would incur the wrath of the goddess Mariana and face her curse. Even the protector would be cursed for failing to safeguard it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Driven by curiosity, Avantika inquired, "Who determined the protector's role? And why would someone take such a colossal risk to safeguard a pearl that equates to a significant loss?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">King Tarang replied, "The protector is chosen by nature itself, and once chosen, they cannot refuse. The only alternative to the protector's role is death. However, the pearl grants one wish to anyone who stands before it, and it is guaranteed to come true. But then the pearl vanishes and returns with its protector."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Afterward, they proceeded to depart. However, Avantika halted, gazing intently at the pearl with a hopeful gaze. Tarang urged, "Why have you paused? Let us go; the others are waiting for us at the palace."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"Maharaj, I have always obeyed your commands, never asking for anything, content with everything you have given and the decisions you have made," Avantika replied. "You mentioned that the pearl could grant any wish. Can't we beg for a child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Tarang remained silent and escorted Queen Avantika out of the room, closing the grand door. As they made their way back to the palace, Avantika stopped him on the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"Please answer me, Maharaj. Why can't we ask for it? Is there something else you're keeping from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"Every boon comes with a curse. I have considered it, and I also wished for a child. However, the pearl requires a sacrifice in exchange for its boon. Whoever makes a wish must give up what they cherish most," Tarang explained. "For me, my people are the most precious, and I cannot sacrifice them for my own happiness."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">After becoming sad, Avantika retreated to her room, where she couldn't stop thinking about the pearl that held the only hope for their child. Only the pearl could bring her happiness and make her feel complete. Despite months passing, Avantika still felt sorrowful when thinking about their child. Tarang wanted nothing more than to see her happy, but he felt helpless in his ability to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">One day, while King Tarang was sitting with his cabinet ministers, an informant arrived with a war notice from Samudrasen, Tarang's brother who had been banished from the kingdom due to his inappropriate behavior and greed for the kingdom's treasures. Samudrasen was a formidable warrior, feared by many, as he possessed immense strength and was renowned for his ability to defeat the strongest of creatures in the ocean with ease. Despite this, he had been unable to conquer the kingdom of <img src="../images/samudrasen.jpg" style="width:65%;display: block; margin-left: auto; float: left; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-right: 1em "> Samudra Nagar due to the power of the pearl, which was not only a magical pearl capable of fulfilling someone's wishes, but also a mystical source of energy that possessed the combined energy of all the oceans, seas, and their creatures. Samudrasen knew that the pearl could turn him into dust within seconds, and as a result, he never directly challenged Tarang and his army. Instead, he would send his best soldiers to attack and loot as much treasure as they could, as he knew that he could never conquer them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">However, this time was different. Samudrasen had planned something else. He sent an army of his best warriors to loot the kingdom, knowing that if they succeeded, Tarang would bring out the pearl to defeat them. Samudrasen planned to kill Tarang from behind and take the pearl. <img src="../images/sea-monster3.jpg" style="width:40%;display: block; margin-left: auto; float: right; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 1em "> His plan worked, and as Tarang lay dying and saw Samudrasen approaching him, he realized what was going to happen. When a person is about to die, the only thing they cherish the most is their life, and Tarang was no exception. Knowing that he couldn't save his own life, he decided to save the pearl and his kingdom from the wrath and curse of the goddess Mariana, which Samudrasen didn't know would befall both of them if he touched the pearl. Tarang chose to make a wish for a child from the pearl just as Samudrasen snatched it from his hand, not delaying a moment to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">The goddess appeared in a state of anger. She had not come to fulfill Tarang's wish, but to curse both Tarang and Samudrasen.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><img src="../images/goddess-mariana.jpg" style="width:60%;display: block; margin-left: auto; float: left; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-right: 1em ">"Samudrasen, you were not chosen as the protector, yet you dared to touch the pearl. I curse you and your army to live in the darkest cave of the Kurseong mountain. Your body can neither bear the rays of the sun nor those reflecting from the moon, so you will never leave the cave." Mariana's anger was palpable, and within seconds, the entire army of Samudrasen had disappeared. It was undoubtedly the effect of the goddess's curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Turning her attention to Tarang, Mariana added, "You will also be punished. I curse you that your child will not live a long life and will die in their first battle."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Tarang, already dying, managed to stand up and bow towards the goddess. "Pardon us, goddess Mariana. I know I am the reason for your anger and a participant in your punishment. Please pardon us."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">The humble request from the king had a calming effect on the goddess's anger. "It is the rule of nature, my son. I cannot change it."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Tarang, still humbled, replied, "But goddess, we already have no child. We tried many ways, but we were unsuccessful. In my desperation, I made my wish from the pearl for a child, but now you have cursed my child before its birth."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"Do not worry, Tarang. The wish from the pearl will come true, but as per its condition, you must sacrifice your most beloved thing," said the goddess.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"Only his life is the most beloved thing for a creature who is on the door of death. Still, I can die for my child. But what about your curse? My child will have to die soon," Tarang started to cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">The goddess felt a pang of sympathy for Tarang, who was a kind and brave king. She decided to give him a boon. "Sacrificing your own life for a child you have not yet seen is truly a great decision. No sacrifice can be greater than this. I promise you that as you die here, your wife will be blessed with a girl child. She will be intelligent, brave, and a great warrior. As for my curse, I cannot change it. However, I will give you a boon. Your daughter will surely die, but she will be reborn with magical powers and a great personality. She will spread her kingdom, vanquish demons, and anyone who poses a threat to this ocean civilization."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">After saying these things, the goddess disappeared. Tarang was happy with the boon he had received. He sacrificed his life for his daughter, and as Tarang died, Avantika became pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">The news of the king's death soon reached the palace. Avantika was heartbroken and filled with sorrow, as was the entire kingdom. The only hope they had was the girl who would be born to Avantika as per the boon of the pearl and the goddess.</span></p><img src="../images/anime-girl-night-6144x4096-9787.jpg" style="width:70%;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; "><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Several months later, the girl child was born and named Isha. A great ceremony was held to celebrate her birth, and it was a moment of great pleasure for everyone except Samudrasen, who was waiting for a chance to escape the cave and enter the sea once again. If he succeeded, then no one would be able to stop him, as neither the king nor the pearl were present. The pearl had already disappeared after fulfilling King Tarang's wish and would only return when nature chose its protector.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">We will have to wait and see whom nature chooses to save the kingdom and pearl or if Samudrasen will destroy the entire kingdom. But you can enjoy the series.</span></p></p>
