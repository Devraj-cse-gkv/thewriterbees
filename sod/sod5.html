										<h1 class="mb-3">Mystery of Anya and Anubhav : Part 1<br></h1><h2>Chapter 5 : Clues and Conspiracies</h2>
										<p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">It was a typical day for Anubhav, or so he thought. Little did he know that his search for clues about Anya's death would lead him to discover that she may be alive. How could a dead person be treated in a hospital? How could she be caught on CCTV footage at a medical store when her body was already found burnt? If all of this was true, then who was the girl that was found burnt and dead?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Anubhav was at a loss. CCTV footage, confirmation from a nurse, a dead body found near a building, a wheelchair, that girl, Anya's husband - everything was so intricately woven together that it was enough to make anyone give up. But Anubhav didn't want to give up. Suddenly, he remembered something. He remembered the lines that the head constable Bholaram had read from the diary on the first day. He flipped through each page of the diary, whose pictures he had taken from the record room. But none of the pages had those lines. "What? Where had those lines gone?" Anubhav was amazed. "What the hell is happening?" Anubhav was irritated. He flipped each and every page again and again, but couldn't find them. He couldn't understand what was going on. He was so depressed and tense that he fell to the ground, unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;">When he opened his eyes, he found himself in a hospital bed. He looked at a nearby table and saw a digital watch showing 6:00 pm and the date 21 August 2020. The sun was setting and peeking through the half-closed window, as if to say goodbye and wish him well. He couldn't remember what had happened or how he got there. The only thing he could clearly recall was inquiring about Anya at the reception. He called for a nurse or an assistant. But he saw Raghav entering the room from the door on his call. He was so unaware of the coming problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Raghav asked, "Why are you getting so tensed Anubhav?" "I am sorry sir. I didn't know you were there," Anubhav said. "Don't worry boy, you need rest this time. Take rest," Raghav said so calmly. He added, "We don't know why you resigned, but it was strange for me to see a well-talented young man give up so easily. And after that, you were getting sick day after day. Is everything right?" This calmness of Raghav was like a silence before a huge thunderstorm. Anubhav couldn't tell him that he was trying to solve the case of Anya. Because he didn't want to be made fun of his words or feelings once again. He replied, "Yes, sir. Everything is fine." Raghav smiled and wished him to get well soon before leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">As Raghav left the hospital, He got up from the bed, put on his slippers, and managed to escape from the hospital, as Raghav ordered the nurse to take care of him and not to discharge him before he gets well completely. He was completely confused. What was Raghav doing there? How did he come to know that Anubhav was admitted here? He had no idea what had happened since morning and what to do now. But one thing he noticed was he saw the police van which carries the dead bodies for postmortem. He thought of Anya's body. Where was it postmortemed? Everything was too entangled.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Did he have the right clues? Had someone manipulated the evidence? Or was there something else that was true, but his mind was deviating from.</span></p></p>
