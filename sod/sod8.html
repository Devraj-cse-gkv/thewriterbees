										<h1 class="mb-3">Mystery of Anya and Anubhav : Part 1<br></h1><h2>Chapter 7 : Chasing Shadows: Anubhav's Quest for Justice</h2>
										<p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i style="font-family: trebuchet; text-align: left;">Sometimes it is easier and more beneficial for us to go into ghost mode, not because we have done something wrong, but to avoid interruptions caused by anyone who does not have good intentions towards our work. Anubhav also decided to do the same because things were becoming clearer in his investigation. The problem he had was that he did not even know who was keeping an eye on him, who did not want this mystery to be resolved. But instead of being bogged down by these things, Anubhav was completely unaware of what would happen next. In this thread of mystery, what new truths will be revealed? Which new challenges are waiting for Anubhav? As of now, Anubhav was quite clear that it was not just a case of suicide or murder; it was something more than it seemed or Anubhav had imagined.</i></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"><span>Having clandestinely left the hospital with Dr. Hussain's assistance, Anubhav promptly returned to his residence. Aware of the potential consequences of lingering too long in one place, he quickly gathered his laptop and incriminating evidence before retrieving emergency funds from both his vault and almirah. Once his room had been secured, Anubhav embarked on his mission, knowing that he was entirely on his own and ill-prepared for the challenges that lay ahead.&nbsp;</span><span>To minimize the risk of detection, Anubhav made the decision to rent a room in a nearby village outside of Delhi, which was conveniently situated close to a railway station.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"><span>Upon arriving at his rented room, Anubhav wasted no time in setting up a meticulously organized pinboard. Carefully arranging each and every piece of evidence and related information, he knew that even the slightest misstep could prove fatal to his cause. With the utmost care and diligence, Anubhav devoted three full days to methodically studying the case in its entirety, examining every detail with a keen eye. During this process, he discovered several crucial facts that had eluded him earlier, which he meticulously recorded on a separate sheet of paper.&nbsp;</span><span>With his newly updated and comprehensive list of events and clues, Anubhav meticulously planned his next moves. Armed with a wealth of evidence, he now needed to identify the critical thread that would connect them all together. To him, it was like a collection of scattered beads, waiting for a single thread to bring them together and reveal the full picture.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Anubhav's investigation began with the first clue on his list - Neha, Anya's sole confidant. He began by visiting the company where Neha and Anya had been employed, inquiring about Neha's sudden absence from work following Anya's untimely demise. Impersonating Neha's relative and citing only the address of the company, Anubhav was able to obtain Neha's home address from the receptionist.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium;">Upon arriving at Neha's residence, Anubhav was met by a woman tending to her plants. Introducing himself as Neha's friend, he inquired about her whereabouts. The woman turned around and said, "Sorry dear, Neha is not here. She went to her grandmother's home. She will be back in one or two months. Come later." He noticed that the lady was blind.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Anubhav pressed further, asking for the location of Neha's grandmother's home so he could meet her there. However, the woman refused to divulge any further information and demanded that Anubhav leave. Becoming frustrated with her lack of cooperation, Anubhav said, "Where is her grandmother's home? Tell me, and I will go there to meet her."&nbsp;</span><span>The woman grew angry and replied, "Didn't you listen? She will be here in one or two months. Go and never come here." Disappointed with the lack of progress from his first attempt, Anubhav left Neha's residence, determined to find another way to continue his investigation.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Anubhav was taken aback by the lady's sudden outburst of emotions. He apologized for his behavior and asked for her help. Initially, the lady refused to take any assistance, but after some gentle persuasion, she relented. Anubhav escorted her inside the house, which was modestly sized but exquisitely arranged. As he looked around, he spotted a photograph on the wall that caught his attention. The lady was standing with a young girl and a small child. To his amazement, the girl in the picture was the same one he had met in the park, and the other girl was the one he had seen in that burnt photograph with that child. Anubhav inquired inquisitively, "Who is this little girl, aunty?" The question stirred up deep emotions in the lady, and she began to cry. "She is Ruhi, Neha's daughter. This is the only photograph where Neha, Ruhi, and I are together," she revealed through tears. Anubhav tried to comfort her, but her anguish only grew. "They burnt my daughter. They kidnapped my granddaughter. I don't know why they left me alive?" she cried uncontrollably. She urged Anubhav to leave the house immediately. Despite his reluctance, he had to comply with her wishes. However, before leaving, he surreptitiously snapped a photo of Neha and Ruhi. As he walked back to his room, he couldn't help but think about the woman's harrowing revelation. According to her, Neha had been burnt alive, and Ruhi had been abducted.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">Anubhav was not in the mood of getting confused anymore or being trapped by the web of this mystery where things seemed true, but were not so. Anubhav reached his room and contacted his friend in Mumbai to get access to all the police branches in Delhi and to find any information about Ruhi and Neha. He emailed his friend their photographs. Anubhav sat on the chair and started thinking about what might have happened. After 20 minutes, Anubhav's phone rang. It was his friend Albert. He sent Anubhav a missing report of Ruhi and a document named a death certificate on his telegram. There was a note that read, "From now on, I cannot help you anymore. If I do so, I will surely get into great trouble, as these documents were on the most secure sites of the Delhi police. If you could, break the phone after accessing these documents." Anubhav was quite surprised, but he decided to agree with Albert. Anubhav opened the documents and couldn't believe what he had seen. In the missing report of Ruhi, there was a complete photograph of her family. He was greatly shocked to see Raghav in that photograph. According to the report, he was Ruhi's father. Anubhav switched to the death certificate, which was of Neha, mentioning Raghav as her husband. But there was something that could surprise everyone. The cause of death mentioned was suicide. The attached postmortem report was similar to that of Anya's report, which forced Anubhav to compare them. Anubhav matched them and found the same serial number of the report, which could never be the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: medium;">What was happening? Was Anya still alive? Were Neha's report and Anya's report swapped to fake her death? If so, then why? It was the first time Anubhav had encountered Raghav. Would the truth about Raghav be revealed? Would Anubhav solve this mystery or get trapped again in the web of mysteries of this case like a helpless insect</span>?</span></p></p>
