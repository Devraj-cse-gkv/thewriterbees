										<h1 class="mb-3">Mystery of Anya and Anubhav : Part 1<br></h1><h2>Chapter 9 : The Puppet Master: Unraveling Raghav's Plan</h2>
										<p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Upon receiving the death reports of Anya and Neha, Anubhav was left in shock. This marked the beginning of a new challenge for him. Since two death certificates could not bear the same serial number, it was evident that their certificates had been tampered with to mislead the investigation. Moreover, the mention of Raghav as Neha's husband added another obstacle for Anubhav to overcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Despite the confusion, Anubhav was determined not to repeat his past mistakes. He returned to his pinboard to add the new clues and points he had gathered. Gradually, things began to make sense as Anubhav suspected that the body found earlier was not of Anya but Neha. Furthermore, Anya appeared to be alive, and the death reports had been falsified to deceive everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">While pondering over these developments, Anubhav recollected an important detail. The diary pages he had clicked as evidence were not burnt, while the diary recovered near the body appeared to be partially burnt. Upon rearranging the pages, Anubhav discovered that some of the pages were missing. He surmised that these pages could contain critical information that would help solve the mystery. Unfortunately, these pieces of evidence were in the custody of Raghav, who seemed to be at the center of everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Anubhav realized that if he wanted to solve the case without falling into the trap of manipulation, he had to pursue Raghav. It was the point where everything came to a standstill. Although he wondered whether Raghav was behind everything or it was just a coincidence, Anubhav had no choice but to proceed with Raghav.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;">To uncover the truth about Raghav, Anubhav went to Akira, Raghav's informant, to know more about him. It was the only way for Anubhav to uncover the truth. Raghav had become a dealer and ensured that the news reached Akira that a man wanted to deal with him about importing gold illegally and needed his help</span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;">Akira agreed to meet him as it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for him. He knew that he couldn't get this type of offer again, and with Raghav's support, he could easily do anything. Anubhav succeeded in creating greed in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Anubhav, disguised as a pirate, met with Akira at a dimly-lit bar on the outskirts of the city. Anubhav took a seat next to Akira and ordered a drink. After a moment, he turned to Akira.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Anubhav: "I hear you're the man to talk to about importing gold."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Akira: "Who wants to know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Anubhav: "Let's just say I'm interested in doing business with you. I have a very lucrative offer."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Akira: "Go on."</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Anubhav: "I need you to import a large amount of gold for me. I'm willing to import gold of about 20,000 crores. And if you can successfully clear the gold, I'll give you a 2% margin of 400 crores."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Akira's eyes widened in surprise. "That's a huge amount of money," he said.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Anubhav: "Yes, but there's one condition. No third person can be involved. This has to be just between us."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">It was a great deal for Akira, and he decided not to tell Raghav anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Akira considered the offer for a moment. It was too good to pass up. "Okay, I'm in. When do we start?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Anubhav: "The shipment will arrive in two days. Meet me at the dockyard at 8 PM. And remember, not a word to anyone else. This has to be our little secret."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">The two men clinked their glasses in agreement before Anubhav got up and left the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: x-large;">After two days, Akira got the news that the shipment had arrived. He went to Raghav to clear the pass for the shipment. Raghav asked, but he managed to beat around the bush and not tell him anything. Raghav was clever; he cleared the documents but silently instructed Constable Gaitonde to follow Akira.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Anubhav was patiently waiting in the vicinity of the ship, eager to observe what was going to unfold. From his vantage point, he noticed Gaitonde tailing Akira. As soon as the shipment was opened, it was discovered to be empty, except for a toy car. Gaitonde was perplexed as to why Akira would conceal this from Raghav. He makes a call to Raghav to tell what happened. Raghav informs him something.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">After he examined the toy car and found nothing, he inquired with Akira, who was taken aback to learn that the shipment contained nothing but a toy car. He also had a message for Akira from Raghav.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Gaitonde approached Akira in a dark alley, his face partially obscured by the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Gaitonde: "You're playing with fire, Akira. You know Raghav doesn't like it when people go behind his back."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Akira: "I don't know what you're talking about, Gaitonde. I'm just trying to make a living, like everyone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Gaitonde: "Don't play dumb with me. I know you're involved in something big, something that could get us all in trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Akira: "I swear, I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just a small-time dealer, trying to get by."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Gaitonde: "Save your lies for someone who cares. We both know you're involved in the gold smuggling. And now, you're trying to hide it from us."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Akira: "I don't know what you're talking about. I've never even met anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Gaitonde: "Don't insult my intelligence. Raghav knows everything, Akira. He knows you met with that smuggler, and he knows you were trying to smuggle gold."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Akira: "How did he find out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Gaitonde: "It doesn't matter how he found out. The point is, you're in deep trouble. Raghav is watching your every move, and if you slip up, it's all over for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Akira: "What am I supposed to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Gaitonde: "Stay out of it. Forget about trying to smuggle gold."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Akira: "But what about my business? How am I supposed to make a living?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Gaitonde: "You'll find a way. Just remember, Akira, you're in this deep because of your own greed. If you keep playing with fire, you're going to get burned." Gaitonde turned and walked away, leaving Akira to contemplate his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Gaitonde cautioned him to be cautious, since it could jeopardize them and Raghav if they were caught engaging in such activities.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Anubhav overheard their conversation loud and clear, thanks to a microphone implanted in the toy car. Suddenly, he overheard Gaitonde discussing how Raghav was already concerned about Anubhav.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"This Anubhav has already caused trouble for us. I don't know why Raghav wants him to stay away from the case, and this Anubhav is fixated on solving it. Because of him, the boss is underground, and Raghav is attempting to mislead him from the investigation. But we have no idea where that man vanished overnight."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Akira inquired, "Which case? Neha's murder?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Gaitonde slapped him hard across the face and told him never to speak of it again under any circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"We're trying to replace it with the death of Anya Ma'am," he explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Akira was taken aback and asked, "What? Why with the boss's death? Is she plotting something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Anubhav couldn't believe his ears after hearing this. Anya was their boss, a mastermind behind everything. It felt like the rug had been pulled out from beneath his feet.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Gaitonde went on to say, "I don't know, brother. They're powerful people. They devise the plans, and we have to execute them. Only then can we satisfy our desires and live the life we're living. I have to go now. Be careful from next time, and don't do anything that can bring us down." Gaitonde hurled the toy into the sea as he departed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Things were taking a new turn, and Anubhav was learning information he never expected. He had loved Anya and wanted to solve this mystery, but he never imagined that Anya herself would plan such a thing. He was left with many questions. Why did Anya make such a move? Why did Neha have to die for this reason? Why did a little girl like Ashu have to lose everything? These were the questions he was pondering. Well you can enjoy the series. Stay tuned!</span></p></p>
