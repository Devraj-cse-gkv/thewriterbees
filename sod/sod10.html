										<h1 class="mb-3">Mystery of Anya and Anubhav : Part 1<br></h1><h2>Chapter 10 : Anubhav's Battle for Justice: The Price of Persistence</h2>
										<p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">It is not difficult to empathize with Anubhav's situation. He had resigned from his job and risked his life to uncover the truth behind a murder case, only to find himself confronted with layers of deception that concealed the real culprits. Despite his best efforts, Anubhav found himself powerless and filled with regret, having never imagined that his pursuit of justice would lead him to this point. The case had come full circle, leaving Anya as the prime suspect despite Anubhav's initial efforts to prove that she had been murdered. To his dismay, it appeared that Anya was the mastermind behind the entire plot, in league with Raghav, the police department, and other unknown accomplices.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">This was a trying time for Anubhav. He had not foreseen the emotional toll that his quest for truth would exact, especially when the person he had once loved deeply was at the center of the web of lies. Despite his misgivings, Anubhav had persevered, driven by a sense of duty and a desire to honor Anya's memory. However, his resolve had faltered in the face of such overwhelming deceit, leaving him feeling lost and uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">As Anubhav made his way home from the shipping area, he was consumed by sorrow, yearning for the solace of the past. He longed to bask in the memories he had shared with Anya in their home, unaware of the danger that awaited him there. Despite the risks, he pressed on, driven by a need to reclaim what had been lost. As he drew nearer to his destination, Anubhav's heart raced with anticipation, knowing that he was about to confront the demons of his past.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">â€œSir, the bus has crossed the 23/5 check post. Anubhav is in the bus, on his way home," a voice crackled through Raghav's radio phone. The message was from one of the policemen assigned to track Anubhav's movements. Raghav had kept surveillance on him since he disappeared and was now getting updates from the traffic cameras.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Raghav smiled like a demon and gave his orders, "No action is needed. How long until he reaches?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"About half an hour," came the reply.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"Keep me updated, but remember to just update me. We can't afford any mistakes," Raghav warned, suppressing his excitement. "I've been waiting for this moment since the day he proposed to her. Now, I'll show him who I am."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Gaitonde teased him, "What did he do wrong by proposing to Anya? They were both unmarried. But you married Anya, even when you were with Neha."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"If everyone could do this, not everyone would be Raghav," he laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"Of course, sir. No one can match you in the universe. At least today, every problem will be thrown out like thorns. From killing the chairman of the NG group company to making Anya the CEO, killing Neha, manipulating medical reports, marrying Neha to grab her property, and this boy comes and tries to uncover us. What a fool," Gaitonde taunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"Right, my boy. But don't say anything like that to yourself. There is a Hindi line that says, 'even walls have ears.' Understood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Gaitonde nodded in agreement, "Yes, sir. But what's next? What's the plan for this fool? And what about Aashu?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"Don't worry, Gaitonde. I have a perfect plan for everyone. I am going to kill them. I won't repeat the same mistake I made by keeping Aashu alive. She's the only witness that I killed Neha. If she escapes, she can cause great danger for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"But sir, Aashu is your daughter. How can you kill your own daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"She is not my daughter," Raghav reacted angrily. "Do as you're told, and don't try to be oversmart. You don't need to know everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Gaitonde became afraid after seeing Raghav turning angry suddenly, and he vowed never to take the name of that girl again. Raghav and Gaitonde left the room to discuss their next plan. While Anubhav was filled with sorrow and the recent events, he was unaware of the upcoming challenges that awaited him as he made his way home. Anubhav stepped off the bus after a few stops and arrived home, where he removed everything that reminded him of Anya. His love for her had been replaced by anger and hate towards a girl who had murdered her best friend and falsified the report. Anubhav didn't even try to understand the reason behind her actions, or whether it was all part of a conspiracy to mislead him. He knew he was right this time. He momentarily wanted to prove everything wrong, but the disappearance of Neha, altered death reports, Aashu, Neha's mother, and everything else provided the thread Anubhav needed to connect all the scattered clues. These events didn't clarify the purpose behind the plans and manipulated proofs, but they made the series of events much clearer. At this point in his journey, Anubhav knew that Anya had planned everything, and Raghav and other policemen had helped her. In his room, Anubhav threw everything from one place to another in a way that a man does when he loses control of his emotions. His anger erupted like burning lava from an active volcano.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Suddenly, Anubhav sees something that shocks him: a bag filled with drugs and narcotics. He realizes that it's a trap set up by Raghav to frame him for smuggling and other crimes. Before he has a chance to regret coming to this place, he finds himself surrounded by a troop of soldiers with guns. Anubhav knows that Raghav is behind this, but he is helpless at this point. With a gun pointed at him, he is taken into police custody and charged with smuggling and supplying drugs to local dealers. Raghav obtains permission to keep him in custody to try and get the names of Anubhav's local contacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Raghav has succeeded in his plan, and Anubhav is now under his control. "I'm finally here to kill you," Raghav says. "Ever since you proposed to Anya, I've been waiting for this moment. And being kind, I will grant your wish for death."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"Wait a minute," Anubhav says, surprised. "You knew me before I joined?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"Of course," Raghav replies with a laugh. "You tried so hard to solve this mystery, but you never thought to ask us. Gaitondey and I were the ones who planned all of this."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Gaitondey chimes in, "Yes, sir. We would have told you everything. After all, we were the ones who orchestrated this entire thing. Please, sir, grant his last wish and tell him everything. Otherwise, he will die without understanding what happened."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"You're right. After all, he is going to die, completing his wish is our duty," Raghav taunted Anubhav and said, "I was the person who loved Anya very much. What did I not do to get her? Do you even know who she is? She is the only daughter of mafia king Sajid Bhai. Her original name is Rukaiya. I fell in love with her when I saw her for the first time. But this news got to her father, and he said that until I get enough money to keep her, I should stay far from her. So, I betrayed him. I gave information to the police to encounter the most dangerous mafia of the west coast of India. I got two benefits from this - Anya was now mine and the badge of bravery for the encounter."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Anubhav spoke in disbelief, "Anya chose a guy who killed her father. What a joke? Do you think I am a duffer?"&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Raghav replied, "No, you are not a duffer. I am smart. The guy who killed her father is Raghav. However, Anya married a police officer named Siddharta."&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Anubhav was shocked to hear the name Siddharta, which he had found on Anya's report in place of her husband. In the CCTV footage of the medical shop, the figure resembling Raghav confirmed his suspicion that Raghav was the person in CCTV footage.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"Why are you shocked, boy? There is more to know. Do you know why I want to kill you? It is all because Anya refused me only because of you. After her father's death, she decided to work honestly and find a job in the NG group company. She met you and started to feel special about you. And do you think I will let her go easily? It was I who recognized her with her own blood, who she is, and what she deserves. I killed the manager to make her the CEO. And when a person realizes that bad things can get results faster than good things, the person chooses the option they are made to choose. So, she did," Raghav said tauntingly, trying to make Anubhav feel what he felt when Anya rejected him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Anubhav now understood why the diary mentioned the strange day of Anya, the sudden success of her, and the success of Raghav. However, he still wondered about Neha. Why was she killed when she did not exist in the plans of Raghav and Anya? As per the diary, Neha was a good friend of Anya.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"And what about Neha? Why did you kill her? And where is Aashu? If you married Anya, then why was your name in Neha's medical reports as her husband and as the father in the missing report of Aashu?" Anubhav asked in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"Calm down, my boy. Why are you getting so excited? Don't worry; I will tell you everything. Actually, Neha was my original wife. I did not like her. I married her as she was the only child of her parents, and I was interested in her property. But her parents refused, so I killed them and made it look like an accident. I gave Neha sympathy and got all her property after marrying her. It was Neha who led me to Anya," Raghav explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Anubhav was outraged, "You killed her own parents for a few properties and money, and even now you killed her? Didn't you even think of her little child and grandmother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">"Stop rubbish! Aashu is not our child, and Neha had seen us killing the manager. So, we decided to kill her and falsify her report with that of Anya's. It destroyed the last clue that could prove the manager had been killed by us. CCTV showed Anya had killed him, but she seemed to commit suicide, and the case closed. You should not come between us. I am bound not to do anything, but when you are taken to court, a terrorist attack will take place, and you will be shot down," Raghav threatened.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">What will happen next? Will Raghav be successful in killing Anubhav and Aashu? Who is Aashu if she is not the child of Raghav and Neha? Where is Anya, the mastermind behind this horrible plan&nbsp;</span></p></p>
