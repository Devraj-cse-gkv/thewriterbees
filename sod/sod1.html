										<h1 class="mb-3">Mystery of Anya and Anubhav : Part 1<br></h1><h2>Chapter 1 : Anya and Emily</h2>
										<p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">"I am from Delhi. You all know the traditions of the normal people of Delhi. Ahh. It is different from what other people think. But after that strange day... The way of my living, the way I used to talk, and my behaviors just changed. My whole life took a sharp turn after that day. I used to be a carefree girl who used to wake up in the morning, enjoying my job with my best friend Neha, the only person in my life who was allowed to enter my room. I was so open with everyone. My hobby was visiting Instagram for reels late at night. But now I am a teacher by profession, teaching business management to the employees with whom I used to work some days ago. Yes, I am successful in my life because of the lesson I learnt that day. What I learnt that day..... What happened to me... Each and everything is a mysterious secret of my life which has been buried deep inside my heart for the last 10 years. Myself Anya Sharma, 6th floor, Shivay building, New Delhi", the head constable of the police station, Noida read it from the diary he found near a fully burnt dead body which seemed to have attempted suicide. The diary was named Emily and was brightly visible on its front cover.</span></p><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">The sub-inspector Gaitonde marked, "probably this is the girl Anya." " Hmm" Inspector Raghav agreed. Before the head-constable Bholaram read anything more from the diary, Constable Anubhav said, " what if it is not a suicide? I think it's a murder." These lines made everyone present there laugh. Anubhav was a newly recruited constable of about 24 years. No one in the Investigation Department took his words seriously. Inspector Raghav made a taunt, "And how are you so sure about it? Is it again your intuitions? Mr Anubhav, let me tell you, police never do their duty with intuitions. We believe what we conclude from the shreds of evidence." Raghav ended his comment after pointing towards a matchbox, a burnt matchstick and a bottle of ground oil spread all around near the body. But Anubhav did not believe them. His heart was saying that this was not a suicide. He wanted to know the truth behind it. He knew very well that while working with the department, he would never get to know the truth. The next day he took a leave of one month. He made up his mind to try every possible thing he could do in these 30 days. Before leaving the police station, he grabbed a copy of all the pieces of evidence including the clicks of pages of the diary in his camera.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Anubhav couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off about the case. He spent the next few days pouring over the evidence, trying to find any clues that may have been overlooked by the department. He talked to Anya's friends and family, trying to piece together her final days. He even went to the building where her body was found, trying to gain any insight he could from the scene of the crime. But despite his best efforts, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was missing something important.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">As the days went on, Anubhav's obsession with the case only grew stronger. He was determined to find out what really happened to Anya, and he wasn't going to let anyone stand in his way. He started to neglect his own personal life, spending all of his time and energy on the case. He was convinced that the key to solving the mystery lay within the pages of Anya's diary, and he spent hours studying every detail, trying to find a hidden clue or a overlooked piece of evidence. He couldn't shake the feeling that her death was not a suicide, but a murder.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">As the days went on, Anubhav's investigation took him down a dark path. He uncovered secrets and lies that shook him to the core. He discovered that Anya had been struggling with a lot of personal issues, including a failed relationship and financial troubles. He also learned that she had been receiving threatening messages and that her life had been in danger. Despite all of this, he couldn't find any concrete evidence that pointed to murder.&nbsp;As his leave of absence came to an end, Anubhav found himself at a crossroads. He knew that he couldn't let the case go, but he also knew that he couldn't continue to pursue it as a police officer. He decided to resign from the department and continue his investigation as a private investigator. He was determined to find the truth and bring justice for Anya.</span></p></p>
