										<h1 class="mb-3">Mystery of Anya and Anubhav : Part 1<br></h1><h2>Chapter 7 : Chasing Shadows: Anubhav's Quest for Justice</h2>
										<p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">When on a mission to uncover the truth buried <span>beneath layers of conspiracies and misleading lies, it's easy to feel defeated. Anubhav was feeling the same way. He didn't know if his destiny would lead him to the truth or if the conspiracies of those watching him would tear him away from it. There's a Hindi quote that says, "</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Lobster;">Time is a word that has given shelter to centuries within itself, and the entire universe breathes in its depths, like an ocean.</span><span style="font-family: georgia;">" Anubhav can only hope for the best. He believes in himself and his dedication to the truth, and he believes that his destiny will lead him to a satisfying conclusion. But who knows what the future holds?</span></span></span></i></p><p></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span><span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">Anubhav and Dr. Ayaan were shocked by the recent turn of events. This was the first time in Dr. Ayaan's long career that he had seen a dead body being kidnapped. Anubhav was frustrated, but he couldn't give up now. They searched the security cameras for any clues, but the low lighting and masked faces made it impossible to identify the kidnappers. However, Dr. Ayaan noticed something important. He took a picture of the footage and led Anubhav out of the room. Anubhav asked, "What's going on, sir? We need to keep trying to identify them." Dr. Ayaan replied, "I have something to show you. Look at this picture." Anubhav replied, "I already saw it on the screen. What can we learn from it? They had masks on." Dr. Ayaan pointed to the feet of the body and said, "Look at them. They're badly burned, but someone who burns themselves alive wouldn't have burned feet." This small detail filled Anubhav with a sense of hope and happiness, reminding him that his intuition was right. As they spoke, the gatekeeper approached and told Dr. Ayaan that the kidnappers had been identified. Their faces were captured on a traffic camera. Anubhav rushed to the police station with Dr. Ayaan, and after a bit of convincing, they were allowed to see the footage.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span><span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">When Anubhav saw the man on the footage, he was filled with shock. It was the same man he had seen on the CCTV footage from the medical store. Before Anubhav could say anything, Dr. Ayaan said, "I think he's the husband of the girl. He came to visit her on the first day she was brought here. He filled out the form. You can get his name from the form." Everything was starting to become clear. Anubhav remembered that he had heard the man's name before, but he couldn't recall where. Then he remembered that it was at the medical store, where the man had purchased the last dose of medicine for Anya.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: large;">Anubhav was tense. On one hand, he finally had evidence that Anya's death was not a suicide, but a murder. On the other hand, there was still evidence that Anya might still be alive. The threads of this mystery were starting to unravel, but neither the beginning nor the end was yet in sight. After these events, Anubhav realized that he was being watched, so he decided to continue his investigation in secret. He dropped his badge and left the hospital without anyone noticing. He asked Dr. Ayaan for one last favor, and he was able to escape from the hospital through a back door.</span></span></p><p></p><p></p><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-size: large;"><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">What will happen next? Will Anubhav return to the medical store? Will he uncover who is following him and who else is connected to this case? Who was the person who claimed to be Anya's husband? Find out in the next installment. Stay tuned!</span></div></span></p>
