										<h1 class="mb-3">Mystery of Anya and Anubhav : Part 1<br></h1><h2>Chapter 6 : Uncovering the Mystery: Race Against Time</h2>
										<p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Lobster;">Who doesn't want to be successful overnight? A luxury life, a car, own house, fame - these are all things people want to have with them until the death. Some people achieve a few of them with their dedication and hard work. As the rule of life goes, "if you do hard work to achieve your goal, destiny will guide you through the tough ways of life, not to steer you off your path to success, but to test whether you truly deserve it." However, some people want to grab all these things at any cost and they only experience happiness for a short time. Raghav was not one of these people. He did many things that will be buried with him, and only their impact will meet him in the end. Anubhav didn't care for himself and sacrificed this time for his friend Anya, whose fate remains a mystery. He doesn't know what's going on or who Raghav and Gaitonde are in relation to the case. He doesn't know what he should do.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: trebuchet;"><i><br /></i></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">After escaping from the hospital, Anubhav reached his home. He had managed to retrieve his bag from the hospital earlier. He was feeling unconscious. Too many intertwined things had started to irritate Anubhav and he was confused. But even amidst all of this, he still remembered Raghav's strange smile. However, he dismissed it, thinking that he was overthinking due to his condition. He heard the horn of a van. Anubhav's house was in a quiet place far away from the city. He chose that place because of his mother, who was a cancer patient. Only the parcel van horns could be heard in that place sometimes. It was the same parcel van. Seeing that van, Anubhav remembered the police van he had seen while escaping from the hospital. He logged into the police branch's service portal to see the details of Anya's postmortem. If Anya were still alive, there wouldn't be such a report. But there was. On the screen of his laptop, Anubhav could clearly see the name of the person, Anya Sharma, along with the name Siddharth&nbsp;Mehra in the column of husband's name. Anubhav thought that he might have heard that name before, but he couldn't remember at that moment. He was so tired that after noting down the name of the hospital and doctor who examined the body, Anubhav lay on his bed and fell asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">After sleeping for about five hours, he woke up. He didn't feel too relaxed or energetic to move ahead. He had some clues, but they were like beads spread out. He needed something that would connect all of them and make everything clear. But it wasn't as simple as it seemed. Anubhav took his phone, locked his room, and keeping the laptop inside, he started his journey to JP hospital, where Anya's body was examined. While traveling, many thoughts struck his mind. What if the report of the body was also manipulated, just like the other evidence?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">Anubhav stepped off the bus, his destination ahead of him, JP hospital. As he entered the hospital, he made his way to the reception desk and enquired about Dr. Ayaan&nbsp;Husain. "Do you have an appointment, sir?" the receptionist asked. "No, I don't have one. But it's urgent, please understand. I am from the police, and I am working on a case," Anubhav replied, showing her his badge. The receptionist assured him that she would make arrangements for him to see the doctor and asked him to wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">After 30 minutes, the receptionist took Anubhav to the doctor's office. Anubhav explained the situation to Dr. Husain and presented him with the report of the post-mortem. The doctor looked at the report and said, "Yes, this report was made by me. I had already mentioned everything in the report. What else do you want to know about?" Anubhav asked, "Was there anything strange about that body or anything that would indicate that it was not an attempted suicide case?" Dr. Husain was surprised as he had never been told that it was a suicide case. He said, "I was never told that it was a suicide case. If it is, I would have to check it again."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: large;">The two of them then made their way to the mortuary. Anubhav asked curiously, "Is the dead body still here? I mean, wasn't there anyone who even claimed her?" The doctor replied, "Unfortunately, no." As they entered the mortuary, they found a crowd gathered outside the department. When they enquired, they found out that some people had come and taken Anya's body forcefully out of the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">Who were they? What was happening? Anubhav was confused as to why everything seemed to slip out of his grasp as he got closer to the truth. Was he being watched every moment? How could he fight against himself, against time, and against a well-planned scheme of a master mind who was using him to destroy evidence? Anubhav's journey was going to be difficult and suspenseful. Stay connected and enjoy the story!</span></p></p>
