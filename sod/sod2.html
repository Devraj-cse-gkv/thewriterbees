										<h1 class="mb-3">Mystery of Anya and Anubhav : Part 1<br></h1><h2>Chapter 2 : The Girl In The Park</h2>
										<p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">It was a beautiful day. The black clouds in the sky were serving as a blanket for the sun, with which it was playing. It seemed that nature was giving signs of the upcoming monsoon in Delhi. It was the 2nd week of August. Anubhav was sitting on a bench in a park, his thoughts revolving around the pages of the diary and the shreds of evidence. He couldn't understand what he should do next. He needed a clue to proceed further. He thought for a moment and unlocked his phone. He finally managed to find the last entry of the diary from the 267 pages that he had clicked from the record room of the police station. It was dated 'September 2nd, 2016, Friday'.</span></p><p style="height: 0px;"></p><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: georgia;"><div style="text-align: justify;">"As usual, I woke up early in the morning. Today Chhotu (who used to bring milk and eggs for her daily) is on leave. I didn't have my breakfast yet. Everything seems to be lost in its place, maybe because I am in a little bit of a hurry for my presentation. My car isn't starting. I made a call to Neha to pick me up. What an unlucky day today is! Well, my heart is beating 100 times faster than usual. Today I am so nervous about my presentation in the office. If it succeeds, I will get an opportunity to be hired as the chief business advisor in the company of...‚Äù Anubhav was shocked. He stopped reading because he couldn't believe that the name of the company mentioned above was NG-Groups.</div></span><span style="font-family: georgia;"><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div></span><span style="font-family: georgia;"><div style="text-align: justify;">The company office was located on the next street, and it was none other than the gate of the building where the dead body of Anya and her diary was found. This made Anubhav a little bit confused but also forced him to think if there was any link between the company and her death. Anubhav had no other option left except to visit the company and find out more about it. Anubhav kept all copies of evidence in his bag and made a determined mind to follow the road to the company, which could be a road to his next clue. He was just about to exit the gate of the park... But he saw a little girl sitting under a tree.</div></span></p><p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><div style="text-align: justify;">Her eyes were full of tears. She had a photograph in her hand. Anubhav asked about her, about that photograph, and why she was crying. The girl told that the photograph was of her mother. The photograph had some signs of burning, that was because her home was set on fire in a massive fight between her village and her neighboring village. Suddenly something triggered Anubhav. He put his hand in his pocket to grab his phone. But his phone was missing. He looked everywhere around and found his phone on the bench he was sitting. He took his phone, unlocked it, and examined every page of the diary. None of the pages had even a sign of small burning or smoke. Anubhav was in deep shock. He ran to that girl. She was not there.</div></span></p><p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><div style="text-align: justify;">Who was she? Why didn't even a single page of the diary have any burn marks? These questions made Anubhav even more convinced that he was right about his suspicions of murder, but they also left him feeling more confused than before. He was determined to visit the NG-Groups company and find out more about their connection to Anya's death. He hoped that this would provide him with the clue he needed to move forward in his investigation. However, he couldn't shake off the image of the little girl and her burning photograph. Anubhav knew that he can't waste too much time to uncover the truth, and he was determined to use every moment to get closer to solving the mysterious case of Anya.</div></span><p></p></p>
