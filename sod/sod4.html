										<h1 class="mb-3">Mystery of Anya and Anubhav : Part 1<br></h1><h2>Chapter 4 : Is Anya Alive?</h2>
										<p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium; text-align: left;">It was a very important day for Anubhav. He was so curious to know the link between the company and Anya's case. He also knew that he would surely get a clue or something helpful from the medical shop he was facing. With a deep breath, Anubhav moved towards the shop. He had a bill from the shop in his hand, which was trembling in such a way that it could be easily noticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">Anubhav moved to the shop and started inquiring. He was completely unaware of the person who had been following him since the previous night. That was none other than Sub-Inspector Gaitonde. Gaitonde was a clever person who was professionally a sub-inspector. But most of the time, he remained busy finding information for Raghav. Both of them were always transferred to the same place at the same time. The reason for these transfers is still a secret of Raghav. Gaitonde, while keeping his eyes on Anubhav, noticed that the shopkeeper told him something that made Anubhav shocked. Suddenly, Anubhav left the shop. He started to run on the street. Gaitonde didn't understand what to do. He informed Raghav about everything that took place at the shop. Raghav ordered him to follow Anubhav every moment without being spotted. Gaitonde obeyed. After 5 minutes, Raghav received a call from him. "Sir, Anubhav is heading towards the City Hospital." "Return from there. Your job finished here for today. Well done, my boy." Raghav ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">Raghav was a person with a mind as cool as ice and as clever as a fox. If you were to ask anyone about Raghav, they would tell you that he was a person with a smiling nature. He took his job seriously, but he used to entertain the whole department with his funny jokes. He had a well-defined, clear image of his personality among everyone. But there was something strange about Raghav. None of the case he was in charge of, was pending or was left unsolved for a long time. Yes, in our country we have many police officers who understand their responsibility and work hard for it. Then, how Raghav was different? The difference is, sometimes the family of accused or families of suspect were unsatisfied. This made multiple complaints to be registered against him. But strangely, not even one action had been taken against him. No one knows the reason, but it clearly shows Raghav had a great reach in the department. Raghav had many of such secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">Anubhav reached to City hospital. It took about one and half hour to reach him there. He asked the reception for a patient named Anya Sharma. Whatever Anubhav knew from the shop was that the medicines, whose payment slip Anubhav had, were for Anya. And the next dose of the medicines were delivered recently to City Hospital about 10 hours ago. Anubhav tried to explain to the shopkeeper that Anya was no more. But he denied. Anubhav showed him the photographs of dead burnt body. But he rejected his statement by showing CCTV footage of the previous night when Anya visited the medical shop. Anubhav couldn't believe his eyes. There was a girl on screen who looked like Anya, sitting in a wheelchair. The shopkeeper told Anubhav, "Well there was a strange thing with the girl. She could see everything and move her wheelchair easily, but she didn't speak a single word. Also, there was a person with her whose behavior was also strange."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">"Strange! In what way?" asked Anubhav. The shopkeeper said, "That man was in a hurry. He was placing calls after every five minutes." Anubhav was still confused and waiting at the reception for a response to his inquiry. The nurse said, "YES. She was in room no. 78, 2nd floor." "She was? What do you mean?" asked Anubhav. The nurse replied, "She had been discharged about an hour ago on a forced request from her husband." "What! Was she married? No, you are getting to some other person. I am asking about Anya Sharma," Anubhav asked with a shocked tone. "I am getting you the right person's details, sir. I have photographs of the patient. She was married and she had a girl named Ashu who calls her aunt," the nurse showed him the details of Anya with photographs. Anubhav didn't know the person, but he was greatly shocked about the girl. She was the same one he met in the park that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;">Anubhav was too confused at this time. But you can enjoy reading. Let's see how many secrets are yet to be revealed in this tour with Anubhav. Will he get anything? Is Anya really alive? And who was the girl the police found that day? Only time will tell as Anubhav continues his investigation.</span></p></p>
